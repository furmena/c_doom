# c_doom

## A quick breakdown
this project was inspired by one of my favourite creators JDH when he made his own doom style renderer. Please that actual doom style renderers use BSP which I don't think I'm smart enough to understand yet so it would more accurate to say this is a Duke Nukem3D style or Build style raycaster
